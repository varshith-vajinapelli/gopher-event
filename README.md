# Gopher Event

Gopher Event is a campus event platform for finding events, creating events, and registering to attend them.

The project has two apps:

| App | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | `frontend/` | React and Vite web app |
| Backend | `backend/` | Express API and Prisma database layer |

## Run locally

Install dependencies in both folders:

```bash
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Create `backend/.env` with `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `RESEND_API_KEY`. Create `frontend/.env.development` with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000`.

Set up the database, then start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev
node src/server.js
```

In another terminal, start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` and the API runs on `http://localhost:5000`.
